				If a garment can be altered Gordana can do it. The items she has altered are endless, 
				from simple trouser length or skirt length adjustments to more technical adjusting of fitted items, 
				lapels, or re-working pieces to a shape which suits a customer better; then adjustment of bridal 
				garments as well as designer wear. Get in touch to discuss your needs and to enquire about prices and lead times.
				<br><br>
				Here are some of the more typical areas of work in alterations.

				<h1>Dressmaking</h1>
				<br>
				The fashion and the dressmaking side of the business has been reduced due to very busy soft furnishing schedule.
				<br><br>
				Still, for existing customers and when the busy soft furnising schedule allows, Gordana makes dresses, jackets, 
				trousers, skirts or coats, using a ready-made pattern, adjusting existing or creating new patterns.
				<br><br>
				Many of you may have an old favourite piece which
				fits perfectly but the fashion has moved on. Gordana can make a pattern out of it and adapt it to keep it current.
				<br><br><br>
				Here is a small sample of garments designed and made by Gordana.
